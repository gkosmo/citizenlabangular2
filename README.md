###  Citizen Lab

# Demand List

# - Logo And Welcome Text Visible

- Achieved on Welcome Page

- Added little fancy css

# - Every Project /w  1.Title; 2. Users; 3.Number of ideas

 - Used a list; cheated on the db and copy paster the users and ideas.
 - used the stars from template for ideas, haven't converted relative to ideas

# - A search box on topthe project by searching in their title and description

 - It searches through descriptions

# - Next to that, as a secondary functionality, the most popular tags and the list of the 5 most trending ideas over all projects should be displayed on the same page in some way, allowing the user to directly access them.

 - I have displayed them separetly. The trending ideas on the welcome page, and the tags on the projects page. In the future, it'd be good to make components at of at least one of them
 -
 
# - The goal for the citizen is to enter one of the projects, where she will be able to see all the ideas related to this project. This idea listing page is not part of the assignment, but reaching a dummy page by clicking should work.

 - Done
